# Browser Capability: viewport
Browser viewport override control. Do not set the viewport during normal browser setup; most tasks should use the existing/default 1280x720 viewport. Use `set()` only when the user asks for specific dimensions, asks to test a responsive breakpoint or device size, or the task cannot be answered correctly without a specific viewport. Do not resize the browser just to make a screenshot larger, prettier, or fit more content. Use the default viewport, a normal screenshot, or a full-page screenshot instead. If you set a temporary viewport, call `reset()` before finishing unless the user asked to keep that viewport.

```ts
const capability = await browser.capabilities.get("viewport");

interface ViewportSize {
  height: number;
  width: number;
}

interface ViewportBrowserCapability {
  reset(): Promise<void>; // Clear the explicit viewport override and return to default browser sizing.
  set(options: ViewportSize): Promise<void>; // Apply an explicit browser viewport override.
}
```
